# Main Figure Scripts (NCL v6.6.2)

This folder contains NCL scripts used to generate **Main Figures 1â€“4** in the manuscript:

**"Consistent projected weakening of Tropical Instability Waves under greenhouse warming"**, submitted to *Nature Communications*.

All scripts were developed and tested using **NCL version 6.6.2**. Each script corresponds to one main figure and relies on CESM-UHR simulation outputs.
